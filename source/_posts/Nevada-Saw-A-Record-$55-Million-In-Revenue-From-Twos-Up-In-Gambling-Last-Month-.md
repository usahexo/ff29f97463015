#  Nevada Saw A Record $55 Million In Revenue From Twos Up In Gambling Last Month 

Reno, Nevada - The landmark winnings from Nevada's two up games in June is a new record for the state. Gambling officials say that revenue from the card game totaled $55 million last month. 

The surge was largely due to increased popularity of Pai Gow Poker and Sic Bo. These games, which are played with dice, contributed to over $24 million of the total revenue. That's a nearly 70% increase over what these games generated in June 2017. 

The craps tables also saw an increase in business, with revenue up more than 12% from the previous year. Slot machines continue to be the biggest earners for casinos, bringing in almost $27 million last month. 

While it's not likely that the current trend will continue, it's been a good year so far for Nevada's casinos. Combined tax revenue from gambling was up 10% in the first four months of 2018, compared to the same period last year.

#  Poker Pro Advises Against Playing Twos Up In Casino Games 

If you're a poker pro, you may think that playing two-up in casino games is a good way to make some extra money. However, before you start wagering your hard-earned cash in this way, it's important to be aware of the risks involved.

In general, casino games are not as favourable to the player as poker is. The house edge is much higher than in poker, so if you're looking to make money by playing games of chance, casinos are not the best place to do it.

That said, there are still some casino games that offer better odds for the player than others. In particular, blackjack and video poker offer better odds than roulette or slots. So if you're going to play casino games, these are two good options to consider.

With regard to two-up, it's important to remember that the house edge is particularly high in this game - around 11%. This means that for every $10 you wager, you can expect to lose $1.11 in the long run.

So while it's possible to win money playing two-up in casino games, it's also very easy to lose money. If you're not comfortable with the notion of potentially losing your entire bankroll, then it's probably best not to play this game at all.

#  Study Shows That 73% Of Casinos Lose Money On Twos Up In Gambling 

The gambling industry is a multibillion-dollar business, and casinos are always looking for an edge to make money. However, a new study has revealed that 73 percent of casinos lose money on twos up in blackjack.

This study was conducted by economists at the University of Pennsylvania. They analyzed over 150 million hands of blackjack played at 44 casinos between 2001 and 2008. They found that the house edge on blackjack is around 1.5 percent, but it increases to 5 percent when players bet on twos up.

This means that the casino loses about $0.50 for every $100 bet on twos up. This may not seem like a lot, but it adds up quickly when you consider how much money is wagered on blackjack each year.

The reason for this is that there are more losing hands when players bet on twos up. For example, there are only two possible outcomes when you bet on a two—either the dealer busts or you win. This means that the casino has a 50/50 chance of winning, and it’s no wonder that they tend to lose money in this situation.

So why do so many people continue to bet on twos up? One reason is that most players are unaware of the house edge in blackjack. In fact, many people mistakenly believe that it’s in the casino’s best interest to let them win.

Another reason is that people tend to be overconfident in their ability to beat the dealer. They think that they can “beat the house” by making smart bets, but this is not usually the case. The truth is that most people are better off just avoiding risky bets like twos up altogether.

#  Atlantic City Is Eyeing A Potential Revival With Twos Up In Gambling 

### Atlantic City Balancing Gambling And Social Issues
Atlantic City is returning to its original draw: gambling. New legislation that allows for two new casinos in the city has breathed new life into AC, with both developers and the city government eyeing potential casino sites.
The city is also considering a measure that would allow residents to gamble from their homes, as well as a proposal to lift the state's ban on sports betting.
These measures are being considered as Atlantic City tries to reverse its fortunes after seeing four of its twelve casinos close in 2014. The closures cost the city about 8,000 jobs and left it saddled with millions of dollars in debt.
While gambling could be a boon for the city, it also comes with social costs. A study by the University of Nevada at Reno found that problem gambling rates are higher in states with legalized gambling.
Atlantic City's comeback will hinge on striking a balance between gambling and social issues.

#  Could Bitcoin Spell The End For Traditional Twos Up In Gambling?

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been gambling’s best kept secret for a while now. Due to the digital currency’s anonymous and decentralized nature, it has become the perfect way to place bets without anyone knowing – until recently.

The rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has seen a corresponding rise in their use in gambling, both legal and illegal. In December 2017, for example, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies was just over $600 billion. A little over a year later, in December 2018, that number had grown to more than $160 billion.

While this is good news for cryptocurrency holders, it could spell trouble for traditional gambling operators such as casinos and bookmakers. After all, why would people bother using their hard-earned money at a physical casino or to bet with a bookmaker when they can do the same thing (and more) with cryptocurrencies?

There are several reasons why cryptocurrency gambling has become so popular in recent years:

1. Cryptocurrencies are global and borderless. This means that you can gamble on anything from horses to football matches anywhere in the world, without having to worry about exchange rates or bank fees.

2. Cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous and decentralized. This means that you don’t need to provide any personal information when you start gambling (unlike with traditional casinos and bookmakers), and that there is no need for a middleman (such as a bank).

3. Cryptocurrencies are relatively safe and secure. Unlike traditional forms of currency, cryptocurrencies are not subject to government or financial institution intervention (unless you store your funds on an exchange). This makes them much less prone to theft or fraud.

4. Cryptocurrencies offer better odds than traditional gambling operators. This is because there is no central authority controlling the odds – they are determined by the free market. As a result, cryptocurrency gamblers can often find much better value for their money than they would at a physical casino or with a bookmaker.
