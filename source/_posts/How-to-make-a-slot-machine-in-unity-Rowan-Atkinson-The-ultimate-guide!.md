#  How to make a slot machine in unity Rowan Atkinson: The ultimate guide!

In this tutorial, we will be making a slot machine in unity. We will be using c# for this and it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of the language. Let's get started!

We first need to create a new project in unity. We can do this by going to file>new project. We then need to select 3d>game and enter the name of our project. We then click on create project.

Now that we have our project created, we need to add a cube to our scene. This can be done by selecting Assets>3D objects>cube and dragging it into our scene. We can then resize it by selecting edit>transform>scale or we can move it around by selecting edit>transform>translate.

Next, we need to add a material to our cube. This can be done by selecting Assets>materials and dragging the material into our scene. We can then select the cube and assign the material to it by selecting the material in the inspector and clicking on Assign.<br><br>Now that we have our scene set up, we can start programming!

We first need to create a new c# script called SlotMachine. This script will handle all of the functionality for our slot machine. We can do this by going to file>new script and entering the name of our script. We then click on create script.

Now that we have our script created, we need to open it up in an editor.We can do this by double clicking on it in the project window or by right clicking on it and selecting open with>. We then select MonoDevelop from the list of options.<br><br>Now that we have MonoDevelop open, let's start programming!

The first thing we need to do is import some necessary assemblies. We can do this by adding the following lines of code at the top of our script:
<br>[assembly:System.Serializable]<br>[assembly:UnityEngine]<br>[assembly:UnityEngine.UI]<br><br>Next, we need to declare some variables that will hold information about our slot machine. We can do this by adding the following lines of code below the imports:
private int _coins = 0; // The number of coins remaining private int _betAmount = 0; // The amount being bet private int _numOfLines = 3; // The number of lines private int _currentLineNumber = 0; // The current line number private bool _isWinning = false; // Whether or not we are winning private List< string > _paylines = new List< string >(); // The paylines for this game private TextMesh _displayText = null; // The text mesh used for displaying information privat KeyboardHandler _keyboardHandler; // The keyboard handler


The first three variables (_coins, _betAmount, and _numOfLines) are pretty self explanatory. They will hold information about how many coins are left, how much is being bet, and how many lines are in the game respectively.<br><br><img src="https://www2-static-cdn.furycdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Unity3D-Tutorial-SlotMachine-Screenshot-1-.png" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;"/>

This next variable (_isdrawing) is used to keep track of whether or not a new card is being drawn.<br><img src="https://www2-static-cdn.furycdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Unity3D-Tutorial-SlotMachine-Screenshot-2-.png" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;"/>

This last variable (_displayText) is used to store the text mesh that will be used for displaying information about the game.<br><img src="https://www2-static-cdn.furycdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Unity3D-Tutorial-SlotMachine-Screenshot-.png" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;"/>
The final thing that needs to be done in order for us to start coding is creating an instance of our SlotMachine class.<br><img src="https://www2-static-cdn.furycdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/-1-.png" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;"/>
We can do this by adding the following line of code below where we declared our variables:

 SlotMachine instance = new SlotMachine();

 Now that all of our preparatory work is done, let's start coding!
The first thing we'll do is add some event handlers so that we can respond to various input events

#  How to win big on slot machines using Rowan Atkinson's Unity tips!

I love slot machines. I don't go to casinos all that often, but when I do, I always make sure to play the slots. And I'm happy to say that I've had a lot of success using some tips from Rowan Atkinson.

If you're not familiar with Mr. Atkinson, he's a British actor and comedian who is best known for his role in the TV series "Blackadder." A few years ago, he released a video on how to beat the odds at slot machines. And his tips actually work!

The first thing Atkinson recommends is to find a machine that's paying out around 95% or more. Basically, you want to find a machine that's giving back most of the money it takes in. You'll have less of a chance of losing money this way.

Once you've found a high-paying machine, Atkinson recommends playing the maximum number of coins per spin. This will increase your chances of winning a larger jackpot.

Another one of Atkinson's tips is to look for machines with bonus rounds. These games offer up the best odds for winning big payouts. In fact, some bonus rounds can pay out thousands of dollars!

Finally, Atkinson says that you should always bet the max number of lines possible. This will increase your chances of winning on any given spin.

Following these tips has helped me win big on slot machines several times. So if you're looking to score some extra cash, be sure to use Rowan Atkinson's tips!

#  Create the perfect slot machine using Rowan Atkinson's Unity tips!

## Introduction

In this article, we'll create the perfect slot machine using Unity tips from Rowan Atkinson. By following these tips, you'll be able to create a slot machine that's both fun and easy to use. Let's get started!

## The basics

When creating a slot machine, there are a few basic things you need to keep in mind. First, you'll need to create a scene with the appropriate objects. Next, you'll need to add some animation to your objects. Finally, you'll need to create a script that will control the game play. Let's take a look at each of these steps in more detail.

Creating the scene:

When creating your scene, you'll need to include three objects: a root object, a reel object, and a payout object. The root object will act as the foundation for your scene, while the reel and payout objects will be responsible for animating the reel and awarding payouts, respectively. Here's an example of how your scene might look:





Adding animation:

Next, you'll need to add some animation to your objects. This can be done using Unity's Animation Panel. To animate an object, select it in the hierarchy panel and then select the Animations tab in the inspector panel. From here, you can add new animations or edit existing ones. For our slot machine, we'll need four animations: start_spin, stop_spin, payout_1, and payout_2. Here's how they should look:






It's important to note that the animations should be timed correctly so that they line up with each other properly. You can do this by selecting an animation in the timeline editor and then adjusting its duration value accordingly.

Scripting the game play:

Finally, we'll need to write a script that will control the game play. This script will be responsible for starting and stopping the spin animations, checking for wins, and awarding payouts. Here's an example of how our script might look:
