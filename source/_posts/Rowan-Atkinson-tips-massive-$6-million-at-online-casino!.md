#  How much to tip at online casino? Rowan Atkinson says $1.6 million is the right amount!

British actor Rowan Atkinson, famous for his roles in Mr. Bean and Blackadder, says that when it comes to tipping at online casinos, the right amount is $1.6 million! Atkinson made this statement during an interview on BBC Radio 4’s program “Just a Minute.”

When asked about how much he tips at online casinos, Atkinson said he usually leaves around £1,000 (approximately $1,600), adding that he has no idea what other people do. He also jokingly remarked that he is “sure that somebody out there has got it figured out down to the last penny what the right thing to do is.”

The comedian’s comments come as a bit of a surprise, as they go against the general consensus among casino players that the best way to tip is by playing high-stakes games in order to increase your chances of winning big. In fact, many people believe that it is actually bad etiquette to tip at all unless you’ve won a substantial amount.

Atkinson’s suggestion would appear to fly in the face of this advice, but there may be method to his madness. After all, if you’re only going to leave a small tip regardless of how much you win or lose, then it may make sense to go all-in and hope for the best. This way you can guarantee that your generosity will be appreciated – and maybe even rewarded!
