#  How to beat the casino at roulette with Rowan Atkinson's help!

Some people think that roulette is all about luck and chance. However, with a little bit of knowledge and understanding of the game, it is possible to beat the casino at roulette. This article will teach you how to do just that with the help of Rowan Atkinson, one of the funniest men on earth!

When playing roulette, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, you need to know what the different types of bets are. There are Inside Bets and Outside Bets:

Inside Bets are bets placed on the numbers on the table. These can be Straight Up Bets (betting on a single number), Split Bets (betting on two adjacent numbers), Street Bets (betting on three numbers in a row), Corner Bets (betting on four numbers that form a square), and Six Line Bets (betting on six numbers that form two rows of three).

Outside Bets are bets placed on areas outside of the numbered grid. These include Columns Bet, Dozen Bet, Red or Black Bet, Odd or Even Bet, and High or Low Bet.

The key to winning at roulette is to place your bets intelligently by using sound mathematical principles. You need to remember that over time, the odds will be in favour of the casino. However, by making shrewd choices with your bets, you can tilt those odds in your favour. Here are some tips:

-Straight Up Bets offer the best odds but also have the lowest payouts. When betting on a single number, make sure that you only bet an amount that you can afford to lose if you don’t win.

-Split Bets are a good way to cover more numbers without risking too much money. For example, if you bet £5 on two adjacent numbers, you would win £10 if either of those numbers comes up.

-Street Bets are also a good way to cover more numbers without risking too much money. For example, if you bet £1 on each of three adjacent numbers, you would win £6 if any of those numbers come up.

-Columns and Dozen Bets are a good way to spread your risk over several different outcomes. For example, betting £1 on Columns 3 through 6 will cover 18 different outcomes (3x2x3). Accordingly, this type of bet has relatively low odds but also offers a decent payout if successful.

-Red or Black Bet and Odd or Even Bet are very simple bets to make and offer even odds for each outcome. Accordingly, these bets offer no real advantage over the house edge so it’s best not to bother with them!
