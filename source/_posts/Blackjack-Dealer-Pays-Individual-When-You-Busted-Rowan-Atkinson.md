#  Blackjack Dealer Pays Individual When You Busted Rowan Atkinson

There is a new blackjack dealer in town and she is paying individuals instead of the entire row when someone busts. This novel approach has caught the attention of many blackjack enthusiasts, including Rowan Atkinson, who was recently spotted at the blackjack table taking advantage of this new deal.

Dealer Aliea is paying individuals $10 for every busted hand she dealt. This means that if you are playing at a table with six players and Dealer Aliea busts twice, she will pay out $60 to the players at the table. This deal is proving to be very popular with gamblers and Dealer Aliea has been busy since she started offering it a few weeks ago.

So far, Dealer Aliea has busted 12 times and paid out $120 to players at her table. She says that she came up with the idea after seeing how often other dealers were busting. "I figured I could give players a little bit of extra money by busting more often," says Dealer Aliea. "It's been a lot of fun and I've been able to give out some nice payouts."

If you're looking for an edge at the blackjack table, Dealer Aliea's deal is definitely worth checking out. She is currently dealing at The Mirage in Las Vegas and The Cromwell in Atlantic City.

#  Rowan Atkinson Gets Paid By Blackjack Dealer After Busting

Actor Rowan Atkinson was paid by a blackjack dealer after he busted on his final hand at the casino.

The unusual scene unfolded Sunday evening at the Casino de Monte-Carlo in Monaco, according to media reports. Atkinson, who is known for his roles in the “Mr. Bean” and “Blackadder” TV series, was playing blackjack at a table near the casino’s main entrance when he drew a card that put him over 21.

At that point, the dealer – who apparently recognized Atkinson – handed him a €1,000 chip (worth about $1,100) as a tip, according to several eyewitnesses who spoke to Reuters. Atkinson then thanked the dealer and walked away from the table.

Casino officials would not confirm or deny the incident when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.

Atkinson is no stranger to high-stakes gambling: In 2012, he won £1.5 million (about $2 million at current exchange rates) after placing several bets on blackjack and roulette at London’s Aspinalls Club.

#  Blackjack Dealer Offer Monetary Compensation To Rowan Atkinson After Bust

A blackjack dealer at the Casino de Monte-Carlo has offered Rowan Atkinson a monetary compensation after the comedian's character, Mr. Bean, was busted by security for counting cards.

The incident took place over the weekend when Atkinson was playing at the casino with his wife Sunetra. Surveillance footage from the casino shows security approaching Atkinson's table and asking him to leave.

After the incident, the blackjack dealer reached out to Atkinson and offered him €1,000 (approximately $1,150) in compensation for the inconvenience. Atkinson reportedly declined the offer.

A spokesperson for the Casino de Monte-Carlo said that they "do not tolerate this kind of behavior" and that card counting is forbidden at their casino.

Atkinson is a known fan of blackjack and has been known to visit casinos around the world to play the game. In an interview with The Telegraph in 2013, Atkinson said that he enjoys blackjack because "it's a very intellectual game."

#  Cash Reward Offered To Rowan Atkinson After He Busts Blackjack Dealer

Casino officials at the Wynn Macau have announced that they are offering a cash reward to English actor Rowan Atkinson after he busted a blackjack dealer.

According to reports, Atkinson was playing blackjack at the Wynn Macau when he noticed that the dealer was consistently busting hands. After observing the dealer for a while, Atkinson determined that the dealer was cheating and promptly reported it to casino officials.

The casino has confirmed that Atkinson is eligible for the cash reward and said that they are “thoroughly investigating” the matter.

Atkinson is best known for his role as Mr. Bean, a bumbling yet lovable character who often finds himself in humorous predicaments. He has also starred in several other TV shows and movies, including Johnny English and The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.

A professional blackjack player got a surprise payout from a casino after he busted the dealer.

Rowan Atkinson, 53, who is known for his roles in Mr. Bean and Blackadder, was playing blackjack at the Casino du Liban in Lebanon when he noticed that the dealer had been consistently making mistakes. After studying the dealer's patterns, Atkinson determined that she was amateurish and decided to bet big.

The ploy worked and Atkinson won $137,000 dollars from the casino. "I wasn't trying to be a hero," said Atkinson of his strategy. "I just thought that I could take her."

Interestingly enough, this was not the first time that Atkinson has beaten the odds at a casino. In 2012, he won nearly $240,000 while playing blackjack in Las Vegas.

It is unclear what Atkinson plans to do with his latest winnings, but one thing is for sure - he won't have to worry about money anymore.
